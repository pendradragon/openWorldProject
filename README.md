# openWorldProject

Parts of the Open World Final Project that are written in code that I do not want to forget/may need to access later. 

This code includes, not is not limited to: static meshes, character skeletons, animation assets, along with anything that I feel may be useful down the project's production line. 

This repository is not a FULL copy of the project that was created. Rather, this repo acts as a dropbox of things that may become useful in the project's development lifetime.
  - I already have so many instances of Microsoft Visual Studio open for other classes -- it is hard to keep track at this point.
