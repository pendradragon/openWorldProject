# openWorldProject

Parts of the Open World Final Project that are written in code that I do not want to forget/may need to access later. 

This code includes, not is not limited to: static meshes, character skeletons, animation assets, along with anything that I feel may be useful down the project's production line. 

This repository is not a FULL copy of the project that was created. Rather, this repo acts as a dropbox of things that may become useful in the project's development lifetime.
  - I already have so many instances of Microsoft Visual Studio open for other classes -- it is hard to keep track at this point.


The majority of the code in this repository is NOT my own. I am simply placing it here so I can access it later on in the project's development lifecycle.
By the code to this repository, I am not claiming ownership or authorship of it.

Acrediation should be provided at the beginning of each file to the correct code author. If there are inconsistencies or you would like to have your work removed from this repository, please contact the repository owner immediately (I am not trying to steal anyone's stuff, simply to access code later in a final class project).
